    "\n",
    "In [Figure 6], we find that the first branch of the decision tree is the feature of PEDROWNOTGRNT which according to the metadata pdf file refers to the fact if pedestrian rights were not granted. Since the values of the features are standard-scaled, the binary values of 0 or 1 are scaled slightly, e.g. in case of PEDROWNOTGRNT, the values of 0 and 1 are converted into -0.201025 and 4.974507, respectively. Thus, the criteria \"PEDROWNOTGRNT ≤ 2.387\" is equivalent to \"is Pedestrian rights were granted?\". Branching to the left means the criteria is true, whereas branching to the right means the criteria is false. A box with sharp blue color on the right side after the first branch means that this feature significantly classify the cases where pedestrian rights were not granted as the cases with injury. This finding could be an encouragement for the Seattle government to enforce the traffic laws on putting pedestrian rights as priority to minimize accidents with injury.\n",
